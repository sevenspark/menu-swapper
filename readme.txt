The Menu Swapper allows you to register custom theme locations and easily swap menus on individual Pages or Posts, all through the WordPress Admin Panel.

The Menu Swapper provides two utilities:

1. A settings page that allows you to register unlimited menu theme locations

2. A meta box that will appear on Pages and Posts, which will allow you to replace existing menu theme locations with your new theme locations for those individual Posts/Pages.
