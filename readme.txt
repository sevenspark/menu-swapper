The Menu Swapper allows you to register custom theme locations and easily swap menus on individual Pages or Posts, all through the WordPress Admin Panel.

== Description ==

The Menu Swapper provides two utilities:

1. A settings page that allows you to register unlimited menu theme locations

2. A meta box that will appear on Pages and Posts, which will allow you to replace existing menu theme locations with your new theme locations for those individual Posts/Pages.
